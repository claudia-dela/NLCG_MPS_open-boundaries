# Variational NLCG on homogeneous MPS with open boundary conditions.
The main file runs three algorithm: the NLCG on homogeneous MPS with open boundary conditions with (1) standard restart, 
(2) reduced restart and (3) a variation of the NLCG (the details are presented in the manuscript of my Phd thesis). 
The code generates data files containing the functional values reached by the algorithms, 
other relevant informations (runtime, mean time of the line search, number of line searches performed) and 
it collects the respective vectors that realize the functional values.
